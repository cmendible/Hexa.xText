Hexa.xText is a .Net command line tool to extract text from source files for later translation, just like the GNU xgettext does.

Extracted text are placed inside po files that must be compiled into satellite assemblies through the included PO2Assembly MSBuild task.

Hexa.xText will extract any string contained in a method call like the following:

function("String to extract");

where function is the method that calls gettext to translate the string.

Usage: Hexa.xText.exe [function] [folder] [language]
